Congratulations on getting through the exercise!

We would like to compliment and thank you on sticking with us until the end :).

It was a tough weekend! A lot of material was covered: navigation and scripting through Bash, introduction to Python and even git and GitHub. 

We hope that you learned a lot over the past couple of days -- it is through the efforts that you put that we learn and advance science. 

Contact us and let us know if you have any inquiries or follow ups, we are here to help.

Thank you.
